## Simple Statistics Report

When you got the processed RNA-DNA interaction data in .pairs format, you definitely want to know some basic data
statistics, such as number of intra- and inter-chromosomal interactions. We provide `imargi_stats.sh` to generate a
simple text data statistics report. The example command is:

``` bash
docker run --rm -t -u 1043 -v ~/imargi_example:/imargi zhonglab/imargi imargi_stats.sh \
    -D 5end \
    -d 200000 \
    -i ./output/final_HEK_iMARGI.pairs.gz \
    -o ./output/report_final_HEK_iMARGI.txt
```

The `-d` argument sets the genomic distance threshold of defining proximal and distal interactions (intra-chromosomal).
It will report the number of proximal and distal interactions. Besides, you can set a list of values separated with `,`,
such as `-d 1000,2000,10000,20000,200000,1000000`, then the report will include the statistics number with different
thresholds (space is not allowed). The distance is directly calculated based on the mapped 5' end position (default
is `-D 5end`). You can use `-D outer` or `-D inner` argument to set using the distance of farthest or nearest ends of
mapped read pair, respectively. When use `-D outer` or `-D inner`, the tool will use the extra cigar information in
the .pairs data.

The generated report includes these statistics:

- Total number of RNA-DNA interactions
- Number of inter-chromosomal interactions
- Number of intra-chromosomal interactions
- Number of distal and proximal intra-chromosomal interactions

## Distance Filtering of Pairs

In the intra-chromosomal interactions, the most majority are short-range (proximal) interactions, which likely represent
interactions between nascent transcripts and their neighboring genomic sequences. We usually filter out those proximal
interactions with a distance threshold, which depends on the requirements of further analysis. We provide
`imargi_distfilter.sh` tool for filtering interaction based on interaction genomic distance. The example command is:

``` bash
docker run --rm -t -u 1043 -v ~/imargi_example:/imargi zhonglab/imargi imargi_distfilter.sh \
    -D 5end \
    -d 20000 \
    -i ./output/final_HEK_iMARGI.pairs.gz \
    -o ./output/filter20k_final_HEK_iMARGI.pairs.gz
```

The command will filter out those intra-chromosomal interactions with genomic distance less than 200,000 (`-d 200000`).
The distance is directly calculated based on the mapped 5' end position (default is `-D 5end`). You can use`-D outer` or
`-D inner` argument to set using the distance of farthest or nearest ends of read pair, respectively. When use
`-D outer` or `-D inner`, the tool will use the extra cigar information in the .pairs data.

## Annotation of Genomic Features

Annotating RNA-ends and DNA-ends with genomic features are valuable for investigation the biological meanings of
RNA-DNA interactions. Using `imargi_annotate.sh`, users can annotate both RNA and DNA ends with gene annotations in
GTF/GFF format or any other genomic features in a simple BED file (each line is a named genomic feature). The example
command below will generate two new gene annotation columns named as gene1 and gene2 in the output .pairs format file.

``` bash
docker run --rm -t -u 1043 -v ~/imargi_example:/imargi zhonglab/imargi imargi_annotate.sh \
    -A gtf \
    -a ./ref/gencode.v24.annotation.gtf \
    -l gene \
    -f gene_id,gene_name,gene_type \
    -C both \
    -c gene1,gene2 \
    -s rn \
    -m 1,1 \
    -G cigar1,cigar2 \
    -i ./output/final_HEK_iMARGI.pairs.gz \
    -o ./output/annot_final_HEK_iMARGI.pairs.gz
```

There are several important arguments you can use to customize your annotation.

- `-A`: Only accept `-A gtf` for annotating gene with GTF file or `-A bed` for annotating any other genomic features
  in a simple BED format file. Default is `-A gtf`. `-a` give the annotation information file.
- `-l`: Annotation level for GTF file. GTF file has different level information, such as exon and gene body. The default
  is annotate based on gene body genomic coordinates, `-l gene`. If you want to strictly annotate, then use `-l exon`
  mode. 
- `-C`: Determine Which end to be annotated. It accepts `-C RNA`, `-C DNA` or `-C both`. Default is `-C both`, then both RNA and
  DNA ends will be annotated. The lowercase `-c` argument give the names of annotation column in the output file.
  If `-C both`, then you need set two column names separated with comma `,`, i.e., `-c gene1,gene2`. Space is not
  allowed. Don't use the 18 reserved column names to name the annotation columns.
- `-f`: annotation feature attributes for GTF file (`-A gtf`). You can set it based on your GTF file content.
  Default is `-f gene_id,gene_name,gene_type`.
- `-s`: Strand specific option. The RNA end of iMARGI is reverse-strand-specific, so we annotate its gene locus using
  its reverse strand.'s' means strand specific, 'r' means reverse-strand-specific, and 'n' means none strand specific, 
  ignoring it. So the default is `-s rn`.
- `-m`: Minimum bases of overlapping for annotation. `-m 1` means at least one base overlapping. `-m 0` means it must be
  inside of the genomic feature. If annotate both ends with `-C both`, then you need two values for `-m` separated by
  comma `,`, such as `-m 1,1`.
- `-G`: cigar information used for annotation. If you only want to annotate based on default position reported in .pairs
  file, i.e., 5' end genomic coordinate, then set `-G false,false`. Default is `-G cigar1,cigar2`.

## Data Format Conversion

For further analysis and visualization, other formats instead of .pairs format might be needed. We provide
`imargi_convert.sh` for converting formats. It can convert .pairs format to BEDPE, .cool and GIVE interaction format
with different `-f` argument options. The example command is below:

``` bash
docker run --rm -t -u 1043 -v ~/imargi_example:/imargi zhonglab/imargi imargi_convert.sh \
    -f bedpe \
    -i ./output/final_HEK_iMARGI.pairs.gz \
    -o ./output/final_HEK_iMARGI.bedpe.gz
```

The command will generate a new BEDPE format file from original .pairs format file. By default, it will drop all the
extra information columns when convert to BEDPE format. You can use `-k` argument with column names separated by
comma `,`, such as `-k cigar1,cigar2`, to keep these columns in the output BEDPE file.

If you change `-f bedpe` to `-f cool` or `-f give`, it will generate .cool/.mcool format or GIVE interaction format
file, respectively, which can be used by HiGlass and GIVE for visualization. With `-f cool`, it will output both
single resolution .cool file and multi-resolution .mcool file. The .mcool file can be used by HiGlass.

## Visualization

There are multiple ways for visualization of RNA-DNA interactions. Here we suggest two interactive visualization
software, [HiGlass](http://higlass.io/) and [GIVE](https://givengine.org).

### HiGlass

HiGlass supports an interactive heatmap visualization of .cool file. So you just need to use `imargi_convert.sh` to
convert .pairs file to .cool/.mcool file.
Please read the [HiGlass documentation](https://github.com/higlass/higlass/wiki) to know how to use it. Besides, there
is an Jupyter Notebook version of HiGlass, [jupyter-higlass](https://github.com/higlass/higlass-jupyter).

**Note:** In the iMARGI `.pairs` file, coordinate of RNA is `c1:p1` and coordinate of DNA is `c2:p2`. We can directly
generate `.mcool` file for HiGlass using `imargi_convert.sh` script. When HiGlass rendering the heatmap view from the
`.mcool` file, it uses a X-Y coordinates system, where X is `c1:p1` and Y is `c2:p2`, so it will show a heatmap of
DNA x RNA matrix, i.e., row is DNA and column is RNA (such as the figure below). Currently, if you want to transpose it,
you have to generate a transposed `.mcool` file. Set `-T true` when you `imargi_convert.sh` script.

### GIVE

GIVE uses links between two traditional linear genome tracks to represents genomic interactions. We just need to use
`imargi_convert.sh` to convert the .pairs format file to GIVE interaction format file. Please read the
[GIVE tutorial](https://github.com/Zhong-Lab-UCSD/Genomic-Interactive-Visualization-Engine/tree/master/tutorials) to
learn how to use it.
